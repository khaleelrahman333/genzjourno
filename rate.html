    This chart shows the number of journalists imprisoned overseas from 2000 to 2024, a figure that has steadily increased over time. Whereas the number of journalists imprisoned internationally remained under 20 until 2018, the most recent figure for 2024 totaled 106 journalists. In fact, the most recent three years (2021-2024) presented the highest shift and eventual spike in the number of journalists imprisoned. Journalists all over the world face issues of press freedom and are often imprisoned as a method of detainment, censorship and government retaliation against what they see as the threat of a free media.
