This chart provides a comparison of the detention rates of journalists across different regions during the most recent year, 2024. In many areas, detention incidents remained relatively low. In regions that have been susceptible to conflict over the past year, such rates have hit untypically high levels as there is more nuanced discussion and difficulties with concern to issues of press freedom and ethical journalism. By utilizing this data visualization, one can see where these issues have been under more strain in 2024 and the current state of journalists worldwide.

    Methodology
    </h2>
    <p>
    This visualization was created using data from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/175x4E2EYCEkk2_l4bPL-eglc3tjyXA-PQe3M0L6QB0g/edit?gid=0#gid=0">Committee to Protect Journalists 2024 Imprisoned Census Dataset.</a> We isolated the data for journalists incarcerated in 2024 and sorted the number of incarcerated journalists by country. We then used Flourish to create a map visualization showing where in the world journalists were incarcerated and indicated the frequency of incarceration with a color gradient.
