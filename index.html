 About 
</h2>

 <p>
    <p>
        Over the past few years, assaults on the free press have skyrocketed internationally. Young people who are concerned about their civil liberties are outraged by this repression and want to stay informed about the state of journalism around the world.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Weâ€™ve written several stories on the incarceration of journalists internationally. We used data and background information provided by the <a href="https://cpj.org/">Committee to Protect Journalists</a> (CPJ), a non-profit dedicated to fighting for global press freedom. 
        </p>

        We hope members of Gen Z passionate about preserving free speech can use our site to stay informed. We also implore readers to check out the <a href="https://cpj.org/">CPJ website</a> for more information and to learn about ways they can get involved.
